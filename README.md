# Text Analysis on Apple Product Reviews

### Introduction

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of iPod reviews using text mining techniques. By leveraging the topicmodels and quanteda libraries in R, the project focuses on extracting meaningful insights from customer feedback. The analysis includes preprocessing the text data, performing sentiment analysis, and conducting topic modeling to identify key themes within the reviews. The repository provides all necessary code and documentation for replicating the analysis, making it a valuable resource for anyone interested in text analytics and sentiment analysis in consumer reviews.

The R notebook which contains the code is the only file in the repository, but the HTML version with the cell outputs can be viewed here: https://nbviewer.org/github/yummyhopper/text_analysis_product_reviews/blob/main/text_analysis.nb.html

### Data

The dataset used in this project was provided by Wharton Customer Analytics, in conjunction with partner companies. This is a real data sets provided for educational purposes. I am not able to put the datasets used in these assignments into this repository as that would be a breach of the Data User Agreement I've signed. The dataset contains apple product reviews with six fields: Review_ID, Item_ID, Review_date, Content	Rating, and Helpful_votes.
